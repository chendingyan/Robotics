## Week 2  
For week 2 lab, we have tasks:  
- [x] Show us a Built and Working Pi/BrickPi Robot with Working WiFi and Motors (4 Marks)  
- [x] Controller Tuning (8 Marks)  
- [x] Distance and Rotation Calibration (5 Marks)  
- [x] Driving Accurately in a Square and Observing Drift (9 Marks)  
- [x] Calculating a Covariance Matrix (4 Marks)  
### Code Refactoring
To improve code readability and reduce complexity. The example code has been refactored. First, it is miscellaneous if we want to add left or right motor's parameter but copy this code block:![enter image description here](https://i.loli.net/2018/10/20/5bcb4d5891a8d.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}
What we did is to build a "json" file which contains all the parameter information in and everytime read from this "json" file.
### Controller Tuning  
We can use "Ziegler-Nichols" heuristic method to tune the PID parameter.</br>  
• set k<sub>i</sub>and k<sub>d</sub> to zero. Increase k<sub>p</sub> until the system starts oscillating with period P<sub>u</sub> (in seconds)  
— remember this gain as k<sub>u</sub>;</br>  
• set k<sub>p</sub> = 0.6k<sub>u</sub>, k<sub>i</sub> = 2k<sub>p</sub>/P<sub>u</sub>, and k<sub>d</sub> = k<sub>p</sub>P<sub>u</sub>/8.</br>
